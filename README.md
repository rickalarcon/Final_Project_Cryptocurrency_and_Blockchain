# DATA SCIENCE/ANALYTICS/INVESTMENTS RESEARCH 
# Authors: Rick J. Alarcon and Adam Atamian
- The report is begins with an introduction and then it is separated into three parts.
- The entire report is contained in one Jupyter Notebook.
- It is to be read from top to bottom.
- Note 1: The interactive plots are not being displayed correctly in GitHub, and the Reddit api data is displayed fully when in the Jupyter Notebook it is supposed to be not fully displayed and scrollable.
- Note 2: Github doesnt support Bokeh, an interactive web visualization, therefore we recommend to use jupyter notebook to run all the graphs.
